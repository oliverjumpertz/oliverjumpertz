## Hi there 👋
I'm Oliver, a Software Engineer and Software Architect.

I currently work for one of Europe's largest streaming services providers, and am the lead for our GraphQL API and infrastructure. Our task is to ensure that millions of users each day can enjoy to watch videos and listen to music or podcasts.

My most favorite programming laguages are TypeScript and Rust.
